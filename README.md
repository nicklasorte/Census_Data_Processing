# Census_Data_Processing

Matlab code to process the Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles:https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html

CENSUS Shapefile Documentation: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/complete-technical-documentation/tiger-geo-line.html

You'll need to download (zipped filed) the necessary shapefiles: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php

-Census Tracts (File for each state)

-Block Groups (File for each state)

-Blocks (File for each state)

-Counties (Nationwide)

-Urban Areas (Nationwide)


You'll then need to unzip each file.


Then run the matlab code to scrap the necessary data.
